## By the community, for the community.

I, @meenzen hereby commit to keeping the Apache 2 license of AwesomeAssertions intact so that you may depend on in as a
drop-in replacement without having to fear any license violations by accidentally upgrading.

## Maintenance

Please do not expect updates to this fork, as I cannot commit to maintaining it in the future. I will do my best to
review and merge critical PRs if required and to release new versions of AwesomeAssertions as needed.

## Acknowledgements

This was made possible by the hard work and dedication of the original authors and more than 200 contributors of
FluentAssertions. We are extremely grateful for their efforts.
