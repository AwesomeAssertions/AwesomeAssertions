# Automatic replacement using Renovate Bot

If you are using Renovate Bot, you can automatically replace FluentAssertions with AwesomeAssertions by adding the
following rule to your `renovate.json`:

```json
{
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "matchPackageNames": ["FluentAssertions"],
      "replacementName": "AwesomeAssertions",
      "replacementVersion": "7.0.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

Renovate will then open PRs to replace FluentAssertions with AwesomeAssertions where applicable.

Alternatively, use PowerShell [script](https://github.com/AwesomeAssertions/AwesomeAssertions/discussions/6) to replace the dependencies.

# How do I build this?
Install Visual Studio 2022 17.14+ or JetBrains Rider 2024.3 as well as the Build Tools 2022 (including the Universal Windows Platform build tools). You will also need to have .NET Framework 4.7 SDK and .NET 9.0 SDK installed. Check the [global.json](global.json) for the current minimum required version.

# What are these Approval.Tests?
This is a special set of tests that use the [Verify](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify) project to verify whether you've introduced any breaking changes in the public API of the library.

If you've verified the changes and decided they are valid, you can accept them  using `AcceptApiChanges.ps1` or `AcceptApiChanges.sh`. Alternatively, you can use the [Verify Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17240-verify-support) plug-in to compare the changes and accept them right from inside Rider. See also the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# FAQ

**Q: Who are the maintainers?**  
**A:** The current maintainers of AwesomeAssertions are @cbersch, @IT-VBFK, @jcfnomada, @jupjohn, @lg2de, and @ScarletKuro.

**Q: Will the license change to a more permissive or restrictive license compared to Apache 2.0?**  
**A:** The license will never change, not even to MIT. We will only maintain the original Apache 2.0 license.

**Q: How is it possible that you released version 8 with almost identical changes if version 8 of FluentAssertions is under a commercial license?**  
**A:** This was possible because the license change was made at the final stage of the version 8 release. Any commits made before the license change were free to use, as licenses cannot be applied retroactively. If commits were added to the branch while it was under the Apache 2.0 license, they remain under Apache 2.0. So, any commits before this change [fluentassertions/fluentassertions@df7e9bf](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions/commit/df7e9bf8305ef5e26ae58fe4142f8d1b6c4fc4af) can be legally used under the Apache 2.0 terms.

**Q: Where can I find the documentation?**  
**A:** You can find the documentation at https://awesomeassertions.org
