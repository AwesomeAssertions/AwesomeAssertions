## By the community, for the community

I, @meenzen hereby commit to keeping the Apache 2 license of AwesomeAssertions intact so that you may depend on in as a
drop-in replacement without having to fear any license violations by accidentally upgrading.

## Maintenance

Please do not expect updates to this fork, as I cannot commit to maintaining it in the future. I will do my best to
review and merge critical PRs if required and to release new versions of AwesomeAssertions as needed.

## Automatic replacement using Renovate Bot

If you are using Renovate Bot, you can automatically replace FluentAssertions with AwesomeAssertions by adding the
following rule to your `renovate.json`:

```json
{
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "matchPackageNames": ["FluentAssertions"],
      "replacementName": "AwesomeAssertions",
      "replacementVersion": "7.0.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

Renovate will then open PRs to replace FluentAssertions with AwesomeAssertions where applicable.

## Acknowledgements

This was made possible by the hard work and dedication of the original authors and more than 200 contributors of
FluentAssertions. We are extremely grateful for their efforts.
